#Lesson 1
#database and variable
#if your want to clear the terminal: windows "cls" , mac "clear"
#if we want to tell computer to print something for us, we use the code print()
#We can also define a word representing certain object


#Example how to print differnet data
name = "john"
print(name)

name = 50
print(name)

name = True 
print(name)
#-------------------------------------------------
name = "peter"
age = "87"
is_male = True 

print(name)
print("Someone called" + name) #We can also combine together
print(name + "87 years old")  #Name will be "peter" and plus the variable in the back
print(name + "hight 187")
print(name + "hate himself 87 years old")
